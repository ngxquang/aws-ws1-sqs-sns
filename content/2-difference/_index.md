Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) and Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) are both messaging services from AWS, but they serve different purposes and architectures.

While **SNS operates on a push model** to distribute notifications to multiple subscribers through a broadcasting mechanism, **SQS uses a pull model** to store and process messages through independent queues.
